# PyWavePropagator

**PyWavePropagator** is a Python package for simulating optical wave propagation in free space and non-homogeneous media.  
It implements both parallel-plane and tilted-plane propagation based on the **angular spectrum method**, as well as beam propagation in media with spatially varying refractive indices.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Supports both parallel and oblique propagation geometries.**
  Accurate free-space propagation in near- and far-fields to parallel/non-parallel planes.

- **Beam Propagation in Non-Homogeneous Media:**  
  Supports wavefield propagation through media with spatially varying refractive index.
